# Project summary to display on homepage.
summary = "Despite the success of Model-Based Systems Engineering adoption, its application at scale and in a continuous approach to ensure the delivery of added value for its adopters is far from straightforward. The inherent complexity in terms of implied domains or of massively heterogeneous and poorly related data is not weaved by the simple use of a formal and disciplined modeling approach. A collaborative and continuous framework and process are required and need to aggregate up-to-date technologies in complementary techniques such as models, ontologies, and complex data management. It is the purpose of this Chair to study and make effective such complementarity."
