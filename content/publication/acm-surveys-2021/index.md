abstract: 'A major determinant of the quality of software systems is the quality of
  their requirements, which should be both understandable and precise. Most requirements
  are written in natural language, which is good for understandability but lacks precision.To
  make requirements precise, researchers have for years advocated the use of mathematics-based
  notations and methods, known as “formal.” Many exist, differing in their style,
  scope, and applicability. The present survey discusses some of the main formal approaches
  and compares them to informal methods.The analysis uses a set of nine complementary
  criteria, such as level of abstraction, tool availability, and traceability support.
  It classifies the approaches into five categories based on their principal style
  for specifying requirements: natural-language, semi-formal, automata/graphs, mathematical,
  and seamless (programming-language-based). It includes examples from all of these
  categories, altogether 21 different approaches, including for example SysML, Relax,
  Eiffel, Event-B, and Alloy.The review discusses a number of open questions, including
  seamlessness, the role of tools and education, and how to make industrial applications
  benefit more from the contributions of formal approaches.'
