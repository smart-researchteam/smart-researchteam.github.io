abstract: This paper presents the results achieved while pursuing the verification
  and validation of a train system behavior at the first steps of development in an
  industrial context. At this stage, and at least from the industrial point of view,
  the train can be considered as a System of Systems (SoS). A method is proposed,
  supported by preliminary results through the definition and verification of constrained
  states and preconditions to use cases, as well as a structure for the behavior.
