 abstract = {Gamification refers to the exploitation of gaming mechanisms for serious purposes,
like learning hard-to-train skills such as modeling.We present a gamified version
of Papyrus, the well-known open source modeling tool. Instructors can use it to easily
create new modeling games (including the tasks, solutions, levels, rewards...) to
help students learning any specific modeling aspect.The evaluation of the game components
is delegated to the GDF gamification framework that bidirectionally communicates with
the Papyrus core via API calls. Our gamified Papyrus includes as well a game dashboard
component implemented with HTML/CSS/Javascript and displayed thanks to the integration
of a web browser embedded in an Eclipse view.},
