Most requirements are written in natural language, which is good for understandability but lacks precision.To make requirements precise, researchers have for years advocated the use of mathematics-based notations and methods, known as “formal.” Many exist, differing in their style, scope, and applicability. The present survey discusses some of the main formal approaches and compares them to informal methods.The analysis uses a set of nine complementary criteria, such as level of abstraction, tool availability, and traceability support. It classifies the approaches into five categories based on their principal style for specifying requirements: natural-language, semi-formal, automata/graphs, mathematical, and seamless (programming-language-based). It includes examples from all of these categories, altogether 21 different approaches, including for example SysML, Relax, Eiffel, Event-B, and Alloy.The review discusses a number of open questions, including seamlessness, the role of tools and education, and how to make industrial applications benefit more from the contributions of formal approaches.","tags":["\"Formal\"","\"specification\"","\"software\"","\"requirement\"","\"seamless\""],"title":"The Role of Formalism in System Requirements","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sylvie Trouilhet","Jean-Paul Arcangeli","Jean-Michel Bruel","Maroun Koussaifi"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633539408,"objectID":"d07e9528d9e042106e3fb2ee6d1dfcb4","permalink":"https://smart-researchteam.github.io/publication/jucs-2021/","publishdate":"2021-07-28T07:40:39.104474Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jucs-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"At the heart of cyber-physical and ambient systems, the user should permanently benefit from applications adapted to the situation and her/his needs. To do this, she/he must be able to configure her/his software environment and be supported as much as possible in that task. To this end, an intelligent \u0026ldquo;engine\u0026rdquo; assembles software components that are present in the ambient environment at the time and makes unanticipated applications emerge. The problem is to put the user \u0026ldquo;in the loop\u0026rdquo;, i.e., provide adapted and intelligible descriptions of the emerging applications, and present them so that the user can accept, modify or reject them. Besides, user feedback must be collected to feed the engine\u0026rsquo;s learning process. Our approach relies on Model-Driven Engineering (MDE). However, differently from the regular use of MDE tools and techniques by engineers to develop software and generate code, our focus is on end-users. Models of component assemblies are represented and made editable for them. Based on a metamodel that supports modeling and de- scription of component-based applications, a user interface provides multi-faceted representations of the emerging applications and captures user feedback. Our solution relies on several domain- specific languages and a transformation process, based on the established MDE tools (Gemoc studio, Eclipse Modeling Framework, EcoreTools, Sirius, Acceleo). It works in conjunction with the intelligent engine that builds the emerging applications and to which it provides learning data.","tags":[],"title":"Model-Driven Engineering for End-Users in the Loop in Smart Ambient Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jean-Michel Bruel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1607684400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633539408,"objectID":"ea720bfcbdd3b7b1f9d068a059933c6e","permalink":"https://smart-researchteam.github.io/talk/20201204-cusi/","publishdate":"2020-12-03T11:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/20201204-cusi/","section":"talk","summary":"Retours sur les impacts de la COVID'19 en termes d'enseignements dans le supérieur","tags":["Teaching"],"title":"Le Monde d’après 2020","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1603411200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633539408,"objectID":"c649b2850663477f8e1ae42e3b5dfb7b","permalink":"https://smart-researchteam.github.io/project/airbus/","publishdate":"2020-10-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/airbus/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":["Lean","MBSE","V\u0026V","Ontology","Requirements"],"title":"Chaire Industrielle","type":"project"},{"authors":["Antonion Bucchiarone","Maxime Savary-Leblanc","Xavier Le Pallec","Jean-Michel Bruel","Antonio Cicchetti","Jordi Cabot","Sebastien Gérard","Hamna Aslam","Annapaola Marconi","Mirko Perillo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1603303200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633539408,"objectID":"6563eeac8e24cc10a3f2d5c360727c2e","permalink":"https://smart-researchteam.github.io/talk/20201021-modelsdemo/","publishdate":"2020-10-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/20201021-modelsdemo/","section":"talk","summary":"Demo of PapyGame by Antonio Bucchiarone","tags":["FUN","Papyrus","Gamification"],"title":"Papyrus for gamers, let's play modeling (Best Demo Award!)","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Jean-Michel Bruel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1603130400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633539408,"objectID":"5b7e9b677836df7827a64a9ca64a407c","permalink":"https://smart-researchteam.github.io/talk/20201019-modelsdocsymp/","publishdate":"2020-10-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/20201019-modelsdocsymp/","section":"talk","summary":"Feedbacks to Ph.D. students","tags":[],"title":"Feedbacks to students","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1603065600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633539408,"objectID":"7706176a80c87e43f5e084da12218c77","permalink":"https://smart-researchteam.github.io/project/innopolis/","publishdate":"2020-10-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/innopolis/","section":"project","summary":"Collaboration initiated with the Innopolis University on the use of formal methods in Requirements Engineering","tags":["Lean","Requirements"],"title":"Formal Requirements","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This (internal) project groups all the initiative related to placing the (final) user as the priority target of the models.\nHere are some examples:\n Maroun\u0026rsquo;s PhD thesis: Interactive Control Environment: https://github.com/marounkoussaifi/ICE Git4School: https://gitlab.com/jeroli.co/git-supervisor Git Supervisor: https://github.com/git4school/git4school-visu  ","date":1603065600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633539408,"objectID":"27a64e05630f85fcc5ef70481838f585","permalink":"https://smart-researchteam.github.io/project/fun/","publishdate":"2020-10-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/fun/","section":"project","summary":"Placing the Final User Needs (FUN) at the center of the (modeling) concerns","tags":["Collaboration","FUN"],"title":"FUN Modeling","type":"project"},{"authors":["Ronan Baduel","Iulian Ober","Jean-Michel Bruel"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1583020800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633539408,"objectID":"2c64a04eb022071dfba3703f57d09797","permalink":"https://smart-researchteam.github.io/publication/ba-ob-br-2020-1/","publishdate":"2020-10-19T13:28:58.534076Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ba-ob-br-2020-1/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper presents the results achieved while pursuing the verification and validation of a train system behavior at the first steps of development in an industrial context.

Model simulation allows conducting early validation and verification activities.  In  the  context  of  Extended  Enterprises,  systems  are  built  out of components developed in different companies as black boxes to protect the company Intellectual Property. Simulation activities then rely on co-simulation that combines the black box simulation of each component  to  assess  the  quality  of  the  whole  system.  Such  activities  are difficult  to  harness  as  the  simulation  results  depend  on  black  box  cosimulation frameworks that coordinate the simulations of each component. Our work targets the modeling of these simulations including the co-simulation framework in order to: a) make explicit all the simulation choices  and  have  a  better  understanding  of  the  simulation  results  and b) benefit from model-driven engineering facilities including automatic code generation. This contribution describes an early experiment based on the classical bouncing ball game example.","tags":["MBSE","Simulation","Publications"],"title":"Modeling Co-simulation: A First Experiment","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In this course, I am teaching specifics of Mobile Applications in terms of modeling activities.\nThis course is taugh since 2015.\n","date":1508457600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1511547527,"objectID":"4999e52c49395b34305ec5b6b9d24baa","permalink":"https://smart-researchteam.github.io/teaching/mobilemodeling/","publishdate":"2017-10-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/mobilemodeling/","section":"teaching","summary":"In this course, I am teaching specifics of Mobile Applications in terms of modeling activities.\nThis course is taugh since 2015.","tags":null,"title":"Mobile Application Modeling","type":"teaching"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1508371200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633539408,"objectID":"9ba40f69b3c32269a9c569727ef5438d","permalink":"https://smart-researchteam.github.io/project/gemoc/","publishdate":"2017-10-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/gemoc/","section":"project","summary":"GEMOC is an open and international initiative that aims to coordinate and disseminate the research results regarding the support of the coordinated use of various modeling languages that will lead to the concept of the globalization of modeling languages.","tags":["Language","Workbench","Globalization","MDE","FUN"],"title":"GEMOC Initiative","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1508371200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633539408,"objectID":"b4f62e4b7f3107d54c2a1e5d14e11a99","permalink":"https://smart-researchteam.github.io/project/moise/","publishdate":"2017-10-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/moise/","section":"project","summary":"MOdels and Information Sharing for System Engineering in Extended Entreprise","tags":["Requirements","Collaboration","Language","MBSE","past"],"title":"Moise","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1507766400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1511547527,"objectID":"c041baf664e1f9ef40c06218f9a880ab","permalink":"https://smart-researchteam.github.io/talk/20171012-cs-irit/","publishdate":"2017-10-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/20171012-cs-irit/","section":"talk","summary":"Presentation of the new SM@RT team at the Scientific board of IRIT","tags":null,"title":"New SM@RT team presentation","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Alexandr Naumchev","Manuel Mazzara","Bertrand Meyer","Jean-Michel Bruel","Florian Galinier","Sophie Ebersold"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1496793600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633539408,"objectID":"14d3c3c3ea53da849343593ac94399e9","permalink":"https://smart-researchteam.github.io/publication/mmbge17/","publishdate":"2017-06-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mmbge17/","section":"publication","summary":"A number of formal methods exist for capturing stimulus-response requirements in a declarative form. Someone yet needs to translate the resulting declarative statements into imperative programs. The present article describes a method for specification and verification of stimulus-response requirements in the form of imperative program routines with conditionals and assertions. A program prover then checks a candidate program directly against the stated requirements. The article illustrates the approach by applying it to an ASM model of the Landing Gear System, a widely used realistic example proposed for evaluating specification and verification techniques.","tags":["Formal Requirements"],"title":"A contract-based method to specify stimulus-response requirements","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francis Bordeleau","Jean-Michel Bruel","Jürgen Dingel","Sébastien Gérard","Henry Muccini","Gunter Mussbacher","Sebastian Voss"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1475452800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633539408,"objectID":"0f987f9a065805027843bd23ca68b86d","permalink":"https://smart-researchteam.github.io/publication/models16/","publishdate":"2016-10-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/models16/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["MDE","Education","Publications"],"title":"Joint Proceedings of the 12th Educators Symposium (EduSymp 2016) and 3rd International Workshop on Open Source Software for Model Driven Engineering (OSS4MDE 2016)","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1425081600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633539408,"objectID":"995516427b8b6c5e932f7fffe6270a5f","permalink":"https://smart-researchteam.github.io/teaching/innopolis/","publishdate":"2020-10-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/innopolis/","section":"teaching","summary":"Master of Science in Information Technology – Software Engineering","tags":["Agile Methods"],"title":"Innopolis University","type":"teaching"}]
