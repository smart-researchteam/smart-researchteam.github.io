Most requirements are written in natural language, which is good for understandability but lacks precision.To make requirements precise, researchers have for years advocated the use of mathematics-based notations and methods, known as “formal.” Many exist, differing in their style, scope, and applicability. The present survey discusses some of the main formal approaches and compares them to informal methods.The analysis uses a set of nine complementary criteria, such as level of abstraction, tool availability, and traceability support. It classifies the approaches into five categories based on their principal style for specifying requirements: natural-language, semi-formal, automata/graphs, mathematical, and seamless (programming-language-based). It includes examples from all of these categories, altogether 21 different approaches, including for example SysML, Relax, Eiffel, Event-B, and Alloy.The review discusses a number of open questions, including seamlessness, the role of tools and education, and how to make industrial applications benefit more from the contributions of formal approaches.","tags":["\"Formal\"","\"specification\"","\"software\"","\"requirement\"","\"seamless\""],"title":"The Role of Formalism in System Requirements","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sophie Ebersold-Marcaillou"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1614556800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633689810,"objectID":"9b2c06a57c0fefe63e35125dcecb9540","permalink":"https://smart-researchteam.github.io/publication/ebersold-tel-03201997/","publishdate":"2021-10-08T09:48:06.599688Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ebersold-tel-03201997/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["\"viewpoints\"","\"Complex system\"","\"partial models\"","\"design\"","\"requirements\"","\"alignment\"","\"alignement\"","\"conception\"","\"exigences\"","\"Système complexe\"","\"points de vue\"","\"modèles partiels\""],"title":"Modélisation des systèmes complexes et Points de vue : l'Ingénierie des Modèles centrée utilisateur pour l'Ingénierie Système","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sylvie Trouilhet","Jean-Paul Arcangeli","Jean-Michel Bruel","Maroun Koussaifi"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633689810,"objectID":"d07e9528d9e042106e3fb2ee6d1dfcb4","permalink":"https://smart-researchteam.github.io/publication/jucs-2021/","publishdate":"2021-10-08T09:48:13.888887Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jucs-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"At the heart of cyber-physical and ambient systems, the user should permanently benefit from applications adapted to the situation and her/his needs. To do this, she/he must be able to configure her/his software environment and be supported as much as possible in that task. To this end, an intelligent \u0026ldquo;engine\u0026rdquo; assembles software components that are present in the ambient environment at the time and makes unanticipated applications emerge. The problem is to put the user \u0026ldquo;in the loop\u0026rdquo;, i.e., provide adapted and intelligible descriptions of the emerging applications, and present them so that the user can accept, modify or reject them. Besides, user feedback must be collected to feed the engine\u0026rsquo;s learning process. Our approach relies on Model-Driven Engineering (MDE). However, differently from the regular use of MDE tools and techniques by engineers to develop software and generate code, our focus is on end-users. Models of component assemblies are represented and made editable for them. Based on a metamodel that supports modeling and de- scription of component-based applications, a user interface provides multi-faceted representations of the emerging applications and captures user feedback. Our solution relies on several domain- specific languages and a transformation process, based on the established MDE tools (Gemoc studio, Eclipse Modeling Framework, EcoreTools, Sirius, Acceleo). It works in conjunction with the intelligent engine that builds the emerging applications and to which it provides learning data.","tags":[],"title":"Model-Driven Engineering for End-Users in the Loop

Applications can here be composed opportunistically and automatically by an intelligent system that puts together available components. Thus, applications that are a priori unknown emerge from the environment. The problem is in the intelligible presentation to an average user of those emerging composite applications. Our approach consists in automatic generation of user-oriented application descriptions from unit descriptions of each component and service. For that, we propose a well-defined language for component description and a method for combining descriptions. A prototype has been developed and used to experiment the generation of different composite application descriptions. Based on these experiments, we assess the degree of fulfillment of the requirements we have identified for the problem.","tags":["\"Service description\"","\"User-oriented description

The development and maintenance of high-performance scientific computing software is reputedly a complex task. This complexity results from the frequent evolutions of supercomputers and the tight coupling between software and hardware aspects. Moreover, current parallel programming approaches result in a mixing of concerns within the source code. Our approach relies on the use of MDE and consists in defining domain-specific modeling languages targeting various domain experts involved in the development of HPC applications, allowing each of them to handle their dedicated model in a both user-friendly and hardware-independent way. The different concerns are separated thanks to the use of several models as well as several modeling viewpoints on these models. Depending on the targeted execution platforms, these abstract models are translated into executable implementations by means of model transformations. To make all of these effective, we have developed a tool chain that is also presented in this paper. The approach is assessed through a multi-dimensional validation that focuses on its applicability, its expressiveness and its efficiency. To capitalize on the gained experience, we analyze some lessons learned during this project.","tags":["MDE","HPC","Recent"],"title":"On the use of models for high-performance scientific computing applications: an experience report","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Manzoor Ahmad","Christophe Gnaho","Jean-Michel Bruel","Régine Laleau"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1530576000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633539408,"objectID":"70038bb7d0c65a33d6740079591868d9","permalink":"https://smart-researchteam.github.io/publication/iwcfs18/","publishdate":"2018-07-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/iwcfs18/","section":"publication","summary":"By nature, Cyber-physical systems are very often submitted to uncertainty events that can occur in their environment. This paper presents the first results of our work on how to deal with environment uncertainty in goal-based requirements engineering. This work is motivated by the fact that current goal-based approaches do not natively allow for unanticipated adaptations. To do so, we explore the introduction of RELAX concepts into SysMLKaos. RELAX is a Requirements Engineering language for Dynamically Adaptive Systems that include explicit constructs to handle the inherent uncertainty in these systems. On the other hand, SysMLKaos is a Goal Based Requirements Engineering approach that takes into account Non-Functional Requirements at the same level of abstraction as Functional Requirements and models the impact of Non-Functional Requirements on Functional Requirements. We use an extract of a Landing Gear System case study to illustrate the proposed approach.","tags":["DSL","Requirements","Publications","RELAX"],"title":"Towards a Requirements Engineering Approach for capturing Uncertainty in Cyber-Physical Systems Environment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maroun Koussaifi","Walid Younes","Françoise Adreit","Jean-Paul Arcangeli","Jean-Michel Bruel","Sylvie Trouilhet"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1530403200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633689810,"objectID":"55f4c82661f1a2ba4eecf3b4f5ed25b2","permalink":"https://smart-researchteam.github.io/publication/koussaifi-hal-02280356/","publishdate":"2021-10-08T09:48:11.038178Z","relpermalink":"/publication/koussaifi-hal-02280356/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["\"Services\"","\"Ambient intelligence\"","\"Connected objects\"","\"Adaptation\"","\"Composition\"","\"Emergence\"","\"Neocampus\"","\"Model-driven engineering\"","\"Multi-agent systems\""],"title":"Emergence of Composite Services in Smart Environments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Florian Galinier"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1530403200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633689810,"objectID":"2cf7be2da1af667143d73654b7c5077e","permalink":"https://smart-researchteam.github.io/publication/galinier-hal-02982979/","publishdate":"2021-10-08T09:48:18.262873Z","relpermalink":"/publication/galinier-hal-02982979/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Seamless development of complex systems: a multirequirements approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Saloua Bennani"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1530403200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633689810,"objectID":"cbb4814567968e40244ee77c1b4b1fbc","permalink":"https://smart-researchteam.github.io/publication/bennani-hal-02982573/","publishdate":"2021-10-08T09:48:17.124489Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bennani-hal-02982573/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Towards a collaborative matching approach to relate sustainable cities design models (poster)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mohammad Chami","Aiste Aleksandraviciene","Aurelijus Morkevicius","Jean-Michel Bruel"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1530403200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633689810,"objectID":"54ed9e1740169a3db8a0aae84ecea34a","permalink":"https://smart-researchteam.github.io/publication/chami-hal-02124403/","publishdate":"2021-10-08T09:48:14.583107Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chami-hal-02124403/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["\"MBSE\""],"title":"Towards Solving MBSE Adoption Challenges: The D3 MBSE Adoption Toolbox","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Florian Galinier","Sophie Ebersold","Jean-Michel Bruel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1530057600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633539408,"objectID":"2caf5015824c2ea5d87bd975fc8348ac","permalink":"https://smart-researchteam.github.io/publication/ciel18/","publishdate":"2018-06-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ciel18/","section":"publication","summary":"La traçabilité et l'intégration des exigences au court du cycle de vie d'un système informatique est un enjeu majeur de l'ingénierie des exigences. En effet, cela permet de s'assurer que le système réponde bien aux attentes du client.

Ce paradigme, situé dans une approche sans rupture, fournit un cadre contraint pour l'expression des exigences, basé sur une formalisation en Eiffel.

From the services present in the environment, other services can be composed opportunistically and automatically by an intelligent system and proposed to the user. The latter must not only to be aware of existing services but also be kept in the loop in order to both control actively the services and influence the automated decisions. This paper first explores the requirements for placing the user in the ambient intelligence loop. Then it describes our approach aimed at answering the requirements, which originality sets in the use of the model-driven engineering paradigm. It reports on the prototype that has been developed , and analyzes the current status of our work towards the different research questions that we have identified.

paper reports on a four-year project that aims to raise the abstraction level through the use of model-driven engineering (MDE) techniques in the development of scientific applications relying on high-performance computing. The development and maintenance of high-performance scientific computing software is reputedly a complex task. This complexity results from the frequent evolutions of supercomputers and the tight coupling between software and hardware aspects. Moreover, current parallel programming approaches result in a mixing of concerns within the source code. Our approach relies on the use of MDE and consists in defining domain-specific modeling languages targeting various domain experts involved in the development of HPC applications, allowing each of them to handle their dedicated model in a both user-friendly and hardware-independent way. The different concerns are separated thanks to the use of several models as well as several modeling viewpoints on these models. Depending on the targeted execution platforms, these abstract models are translated into executable implementations by means of model transformations. To make all of these effective, we have developed a tool chain that is also presented in this paper. The approach is assessed through a multi-dimensional validation that focuses on its applicability, its expressiveness and its efficiency. To capitalize on the gained experience, we analyze some lessons learned during this project.","tags":["\"HPC\"","\"High-performance calculus\"","\"MDE Model-driven

Systems Engineering plays a key role in managing the complexity in the development of modern cyber-physical systems. Model simulation allows conducting early validation and verification activities.  In  the  context  of  Extended  Enterprises,  systems  are  built  out of components developed in different companies as black boxes to protect the company Intellectual Property. Simulation activities then rely on co-simulation that combines the black box simulation of each component  to  assess  the  quality  of  the  whole  system.  Such  activities  are difficult  to  harness  as  the  simulation  results  depend  on  black  box  cosimulation frameworks that coordinate the simulations of each component. Our work targets the modeling of these simulations including the co-simulation framework in order to: a) make explicit all the simulation choices  and  have  a  better  understanding  of  the  simulation  results  and b) benefit from model-driven engineering facilities including automatic code generation. This contribution describes an early experiment based on the classical bouncing ball game example.","tags":["MBSE","Simulation","Publications"],"title":"Modeling Co-simulation: A First Experiment","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1508371200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633539408,"objectID":"9ba40f69b3c32269a9c569727ef5438d","permalink":"https://smart-researchteam.github.io/project/gemoc/","publishdate":"2017-10-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/gemoc/","section":"project","summary":"GEMOC is an open and international initiative that aims to coordinate and disseminate the research results regarding the support of the coordinated use of various modeling languages that will lead to the concept of the globalization of modeling languages.","tags":["Language","Workbench","Globalization","MDE","FUN"],"title":"GEMOC Initiative","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1508371200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633539408,"objectID":"b4f62e4b7f3107d54c2a1e5d14e11a99","permalink":"https://smart-researchteam.github.io/project/moise/","publishdate":"2017-10-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/moise/","section":"project","summary":"MOdels and Information Sharing for System Engineering in Extended Entreprise","tags":["Requirements","Collaboration","Language","MBSE","past"],"title":"Moise","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1507766400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1511547527,"objectID":"c041baf664e1f9ef40c06218f9a880ab","permalink":"https://smart-researchteam.github.io/talk/20171012-cs-irit/","publishdate":"2017-10-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/20171012-cs-irit/","section":"talk","summary":"Presentation of the new SM@RT team at the Scientific board of IRIT","tags":null,"title":"New SM@RT team presentation","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Alexandr Naumchev","Manuel Mazzara","Bertrand Meyer","Jean-Michel Bruel","Florian Galinier","Sophie Ebersold"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1496793600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633539408,"objectID":"14d3c3c3ea53da849343593ac94399e9","permalink":"https://smart-researchteam.github.io/publication/mmbge17/","publishdate":"2017-06-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mmbge17/","section":"publication","summary":"A number of formal methods exist for capturing stimulus-response requirements in a declarative form. Someone yet needs to translate the resulting declarative statements into imperative programs. The present article describes a method for specification and verification of stimulus-response requirements in the form of imperative program routines with conditionals and assertions. A program prover then checks a candidate program directly against the stated requirements. The article illustrates the approach by applying it to an ASM model of the Landing Gear System, a widely used realistic example proposed for evaluating specification and verification techniques.","tags":["Formal Requirements"],"title":"A contract-based method to specify stimulus-response requirements","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Florian Galinier","Jean-Michel Bruel","Sophie Ebersold-Marcaillou","Bertrand Meyer"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1496275200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633689810,"objectID":"245fbe6f247208ac1611e21d82a2524e","permalink":"https://smart-researchteam.github.io/publication/galinier-hal-02864409/","publishdate":"2021-10-08T09:48:04.252212Z","relpermalink":"/publication/galinier-hal-02864409/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["\"Développement de systèmes complexes\""],"title":"Intégration des (multi-)exigences tout au long du développement des systèmes complexes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexandr Naumchev","Manuel Mazzara","Bertrand Meyer","Jean-Michel Bruel","Florian Galinier","Sophie Ebersold-Marcaillou"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633689810,"objectID":"0ea4e8caf48726eeea1f49c21a1b638a","permalink":"https://smart-researchteam.github.io/publication/naumchev-hal-03120284/","publishdate":"2021-10-08T09:48:04.033596Z","relpermalink":"/publication/naumchev-hal-03120284/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["\"Landing Gear System\"","\"Eiffel\"","\"Auto-Proof\"","\"Design by Contract\"","\"Seamless Requirements\""],"title":"A contract-based method to specify stimulus-response requirements","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francis Bordeleau","Jean-Michel Bruel","Jürgen Dingel","Sébastien Gérard","Henry Muccini","Gunter Mussbacher","Sebastian Voss"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1475452800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633539408,"objectID":"0f987f9a065805027843bd23ca68b86d","permalink":"https://smart-researchteam.github.io/publication/models16/","publishdate":"2016-10-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/models16/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["MDE","Education","Publications"],"title":"Joint Proceedings of the 12th Educators Symposium (EduSymp 2016) and 3rd International Workshop on Open Source Software for Model Driven Engineering (OSS4MDE 2016)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Samba Diaw","Redouane Lbath","Bernard Coulette"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633689810,"objectID":"6971b589867b08220c4733394ec059ec","permalink":"https://smart-researchteam.github.io/publication/diaw-hal-03260624/","publishdate":"2021-10-08T09:48:21.896388Z","relpermalink":"/publication/diaw-hal-03260624/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Spem4mde : Un métamodèle et un environnement pour la modélisation et la mise en øeuvre assistée de processus IDM","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Huaxi Yulin Zhang","Christelle Urtado","Sylvain Vauttier","Lei Zhang","Marianne Huchard","Bernard Coulette"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1343779200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633689810,"objectID":"7523a15e9edca0c319cff5cd27f093af","permalink":"https://smart-researchteam.github.io/publication/zhang-hal-00714629/","publishdate":"2021-10-08T09:48:22.613629Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zhang-hal-00714629/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["\"Architecture description language\"","\"Architecture evolution\"","\"Change description\""],"title":"Dedal-CDL: Modeling First-class Architectural Changes in Dedal","type":"publication"}]
